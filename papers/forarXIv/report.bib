	abstract = {Although mixed precision arithmetic has recently garnered interest for training dense neural networks, many other applications could benefit from the  speed-ups and lower storage if applied appropriately. 
	The growing interest in employing mixed precision computations motivates the need for rounding error analysis that properly handles behavior from mixed precision arithmetic.
	We present a framework for mixed precision analysis that builds on the foundations of rounding error analysis presented in \cite{Higham2002} and demonstrate its practicality by applying the analysis to various Householder QR Algorithms. 
	In addition, we present successful results from using mixed precision QR factorization for some small-scale benchmark problems in graph clustering. },

abstract="In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.",

volume="29",
number="1",
pages="111--130",
abstract="The AllReduce algorithm is a promising new algorithm for parallelizing the Householder QR decomposition A = QR of a tall and skinny matrix. It divides the input matrix A vertically in a recursive manner, computes the QR decompositions of each submatrix independently, and merges the results to obtain the QR decomposition of A. While this algorithm has been shown to achieve excellent speedup in various parallel environments, its rounding error properties have not been elucidated yet. In this paper, we present theoretical error analysis of the AllReduce algorithm. Specifically, we derive bounds for the backward error of A and deviation from orthogonality of the computed Q factor. Our analysis shows that both of these bounds are smaller than their counterparts for the conventional Householder QR algorithm. Moreover, the bounds decrease as the number of submatrices increases. These results are supported by numerical experiments. Thus we can conclude that the AllReduce algorithm can be used as a reliable method of orthogonalization in parallel environments.",

One such application is lattice quantum chromodynamics (lattice QCD), where the main computational challenge is to efficiently solve the discretized Dirac equation in the presence of an SU(3) gauge field. Using NVIDIA's CUDA platform we have implemented a Wilson–Dirac sparse matrix–vector product that performs at up to 40, 135 and 212 Gflops for double, single and half precision respectively on NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 280 GPU. We have developed a new mixed precision approach for Krylov solvers using reliable updates which allows for full double precision accuracy while using only single or half precision arithmetic for the bulk of the computation. The resulting BiCGstab and CG solvers run in excess of 100 Gflops and, in terms of iterations until convergence, perform better than the usual defect-correction approach for mixed precision."
