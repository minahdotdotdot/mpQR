We introduce the Householder QR factorization algorithm (HQR) in \cref{sec:HQR} and two block variants that use HQR within the block in \cref{sec:BQR,sec:TSQR}. 
The blocked HQR (BQR) in \cref{sec:BQR} partitions the columns of the target matrix  and is a well-known algorithm that uses the WY representation of \cite{Bischof1987} that utilizes mainly level-3 BLAS operations.
%\cite{Schreiber1989}.
In contrast, the Tall-and-Skinny QR (TSQR) in \cref{sec:TSQR} partitions rows of the matrix and takes a communication-avoiding divide-and-conquer approach that can be easily parallelized (see \cite{Demmel2007}).
We also present the standard rounding error analysis of these algorithms which will be tweaked for various mixed precision assumptions in \cref{sec:mpanalysis}.
